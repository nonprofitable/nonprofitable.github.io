# Nonprofitable.org

This repository holds the codebase for the 2017 relaunch of the Nonprofitable.org website. This is the second Jekyll incarnation of the project; it was migrated from Drupal 7 in late '15. There's a lot of site-specific CSS here, loosely based on the Creative Theme; if anyone is interested in reusing the design, let me know and I'll try to spin off a standalone theme when I've got some spare time.

Custom CSS is in base.scss.
